### This branch is under heavy development!

This is intended to create a more generalized pcb generator for many other projects, outside of keyboards.

Mainly, I wish to modify the files so that I can create a version of Slime VR that is really easy to modify and stuff.

The project is really cool, so being able to do keyboards and more would be excellent.
